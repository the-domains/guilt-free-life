Sometime this summer I realized that I no longer stashed my travel bags with the unused travel-sized personal care products that hotels provided daily for guests. In my past years of traveling, I was sure to stow away the unused shampoo deep in my suitcase, so that the housekeeping staff would restock it the next day. That way, I could bring it home for use during another trip.

I travel about once a month, and so you can imagine that I built up quite a stash of free shampoo, conditioner, and moisturizing lotion. On occasion, there'd be a score--mouthwash or a sewing kit--and I would really feel like I hit the jackpot.

Yet while packing to move into our new ranch, I looked under the sink in my bathroom and I found 3 gallon-sized zip loc bags full of these travel sized products. I had rarely an opportunity to use them, for each time I traveled, I got more.

I felt a flash of guilt. It felt like stealing to me, for I took something that I really hadn't needed, just because it was free.

Today, I checked out of a hotel in Marion, North Carolina, and I looked long and hard at that triptych of products, lined up and staring me down. I let them rest there, but I did take something I did need--a makeup remover package that I could actually use.

So off to the women's shelter go my three gallon-sized zip loc bags, for at this time in my life, I have enough.
