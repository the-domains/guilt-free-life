I wonder if I should be the one to write about this subject just now, but they say that you learn by teaching. So yesterday, I quit my very well-paying job to...well I'm not sure what I am going to do. Being a Scanner (a term penned by Barbara Sher in her wildly successful book `[Refuse to Choose!: Use All of Your Interests, Passions, and Hobbies to Create the Life and Career of Your Dreams][0]) `I have a Basecamp account filled with money making options that span from beekeeping to equine stem cell generation. Each of these options provides opportunity for income, growth and life experience for me, but which should I do first?

Perhaps I could do an in-depth financial analysis of the viability of each possible venture (boring) or go work as an employee with someone who's already successful (dishonest and sneaky in my opinion). But it's the starting from scratch, making mistakes, and learning from the ground up that appeals to me. Of course I will do basic market studies, and pay someone to research regulations, best practices and insurance needs. But all in all, I just took the jump without being prepared for any one venture.

That last day at work was a scary one, and when I handed in my badge and was walked out of the door one last time, I was struck with a debilitating fear that perhaps I had made the wrong decision. My mother, who grew up during the depression, was all about safety. Living on the least amount possible and stashing the rest of the money for hard times. She used rubber bands to bind soap chips together to get more use out of them. Were she alive, I can hardly imagine that she would support my decision to up and leave a job--any job--in order to pursue something that at the moment eludes me. She would have wanted a solid plan in place, bills paid for a year, and then the jump would have been condoned. But not the way I did it.

We all know that times are different now, and people change careers all the time. My careers have spanned from bartending to goldsmithing to home appraiser. I have been a professional quilter, and a gemologist and a published author. Each time I changed careers, I was told to "grow up" and make up my mind. However, these rash changes seemed to make sense for me at that particular time in my life.

And this one does now, despite the fear.

So off I go, with the support of many people who are confident that I will do just fine, even if I doubt myself at brief intervals during my day. It's a risk I'm taking to propel myself closer to Who I Really Am. I may have to bind up my soap chips for a little while until adjustments are made, but I'm ok with that. After all, abundance is everywhere.
