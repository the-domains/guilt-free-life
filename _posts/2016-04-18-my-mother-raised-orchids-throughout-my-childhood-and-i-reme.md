Orchids are Ugly -- But Watch Them Bloom
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/96bd7c80-5d2a-4d32-9eb8-b58a940bcfa9.jpg)

My mother raised orchids throughout my childhood, and I remember as a teenager how I used to comment how ugly they were. With twisted roots that protruded from the pot, and leaves that flopped in various directions, I wondered why my mother had such an obsession with them.

But when they bloomed...I was breathless. Not only were the flowers magnificent, but they lasted for months. And I remember what she told me: "Don't be so quick to judge, for you never really know much about a thing until you live with it for a while."

And so, as I grew up, I experienced many quick-to-judge situations, and applied prejudice where it was never needed, and I suffered the consequences of missing out on some pretty cool experiences because I was too closed-minded on this subject or that. I softened a bit as I aged, and my mother's statements about letting people be "who they were" solidified into a belief that I could live a more guilt-free life if I only stood back, observed, and accepted. My judgments of people did not change who I was judging; rather it just defined myself as someone who judged.

One of the keys to living a guilt-free life is to stand back, soften up, and just watch what blooms. It's about knowing who YOU are, and allowing others to live their desired experiences being who THEY are, without your deciding what is best for them; whether that be their appearance, their behavior, or their choices.

I now have a whole greenhouse of orchids; much of the year they are still those floppy leaves and meandering roots. But every few months, one will bloom in all its splendor, and I thank it--and my mother--for this important lesson.
