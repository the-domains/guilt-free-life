<p>Yesterday, my Internet went out. For a blogger that can be detrimental, especially if we forget how to actually write with a pencil on paper. I had been given homework after having an animal communicator visit this week to help diagnose my draft horse's behavioral problems and I was eager to write about it. The communicator is helping us learn to interact with our horses in a more natural manner; letting them be horses, for example, rather than high-stepping prisoners that should never misbehave.</p><p>I thought that he would have me perform certain exercises on the ground with my horse, but his assignment went in a completely different direction. My homework was to clear out my own fears.</p><p>Now horses are big, and they can sometimes hurt us without intentionally trying. So fear would be a healthy and natural emotion in the presence of these large animals. But it also gets in the way of communicating with the horse, and this is what was happening to me. After three stitches in the head last week from close contact with some large hooves, my fear was keeping me from letting my horses be what they are: fight or flight animals that just may have a difficult time trusting a prey animal such as me, who (in their eyes) might eat them at anytime.</p><p>So the fear is reciprocal, and it takes effort on both sides to eliminate it. I had a hard time believing that an 1800 pound Percheron would fear me, but if I had taken the time to view life from his perspective, it makes perfect sense.</p><p>In order to clear my fears, I was told to visualize the knot in my stomach, and melt it away.</p><p>I didn't even know it was there, but when the communicator mentioned it, and I focused on that area just between and below my breasts, there it was...a tight knot that sat like a giant pit, blocking me from acting with love. Deep breaths ensued, and by the end of yesterday, I could melt it inside before interacting with my horse. He could tell right away; his demeanor changed from fearful and easily spooked to calm and tender. His eye softened. He obliged my gentle requests to exercise without the argument that had often preceded previous attempts.</p><p>I sat in a lawn chair in the middle of the round pen and he paced around me in circles for over an hour. Since past experience had related that pen with intense exercise that left him exhausted, it took a very long time for him to realize that I was going to ask nothing of him today.</p><p>Simply by melting my own fears, I had helped alleviate the fear of another.</p><p>Next time you wonder, "How can one person make a difference in this world?" check for that pit in your stomach and determine if your fear is projecting to others. Do you see it in their eyes? If so, take deep breaths, and envision the pit melting away, and replace it with love with no expectations.</p><p>Now that's peace.</p><picture>
