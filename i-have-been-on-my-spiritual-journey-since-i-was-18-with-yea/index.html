Lately, in my forties, I have focused the majority of my daily inner reflection on my self-evolution, which includes manifestation of my desires. I attempt to police my thoughts very carefully lately, for as I discovered recently, the time between when I project my desire to when I see it manifest in my reality is decreasing very quickly (see below for a comment about my use of the word "time" here).</p><p>I have several people a day ask me about how to develop their manifestation skills, and I tell them the same thing:</p><p>Be careful what you wish for.</p><p>A cliche, right? There is no genie in a bottle, but only you sending energy at a certain vibration out to the Universe, and the Universe matching it. That's it, folks, that's all there is. You send it, it comes to you. It works every time, each time, and it always matches your strongest thoughts when mixed with feelings.</p><p>Why did I include feelings in that last statement? Because, thankfully, the Universe does allow us--while in our physical bodies--to perceive a time delay between what we ask for and when it's delivered. This gives us chances to--ahem--update our thoughts to reflect on what we are requesting to ensure it really serves us. Now we can KNOW that we're doing this, or we can do it unconsciously. It's entirely up to us whether or not we choose to be self aware of our requests. The Universe doesn't care either way.</p><p>I experienced an uncomfortable example of this a few weeks ago, when I was negotiating the purchase of a beautiful palomino horse in Kentucky. This being the first horse I was purchasing sight unseen, I was a bit leery about not seeing her first, and completely uncomfortable with paying $1000 to ship her here. "Highway robbery!" my ego said to me in a weak moment. I began to second guess the purchase, and wonder if I shouldn't just be satisfied with the three horses I already have. It wasn't but 24 hours before the whole deal fell through, and I was out of my obligation to purchase the horse when the seller sold her locally despite having made a deal with us. I had manifested the failure to follow through<em>in a matter of hours</em>.

And if this is the case, remember to be conscious about your thoughts and feelings, for you are well aware that sustained, focused thought is what is creating reality--and you get what you ask for.</p><picture>
